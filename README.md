# DS_Discussion - D-Tale Demo

## Description

D-Tale is a tool you can use to analyse, manipulate, and visualise data stored in Pandas DataFrames.

It's a combination of a Python (Flask) back-end with a React front-end. For more info see the [D-Tale repo here](https://github.com/man-group/dtale).

This repository helps you get set up with D-Tale quickly so you can see what it's all about. It will:

- Install D-Tale
- Load some covid-19 data into a Pandas DataFrame
- Launche D-Tale and loads the covid data into it

Then you can explore D-Tale and see what it can do, and if it might be useful to you in your projects.

## Getting Started

1. Click the "Code" button and then click "Create Codespace on Main"
2. Wait for the VM to start up and install everything
3. Open up d-tale.ipynb and follow the instructions in there

## Some things to try

- The data column has imported as a string. Click its column header, "Type Conversion", then put in the date format (you'll just need to add the hyphens). Note how it shows you the Python code to do this.
- Click the play icon in the top left. Try making some charts.
